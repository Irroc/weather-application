# My Weather Application
## Description
This is my weather application so that when a user is traveling or wants to klnow the forcasted weather all they have to do is search the cities name to get the weather. The old searches will be saved so if the user wants to check the weather again later a button in the history section will already available to click so you dont have to search it again. 

## Usage
To use the page simply search the city you wish to know the weather of. If you have already searched for the city on the page before, a button with the citys name on it will be displayd to quickly access the current and forcasted weather. If you have searched multiple cities it will save all of them with their own buttons to get to each of their forcasts.
